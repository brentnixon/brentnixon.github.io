<p>The goal of this project was to build a model that, trained on financial and email data for the Enron employees, could then predict whether an unseen employee, by virtue of their data, was a person-of-interest (POI) in the fraud investigation. Machine learning is useful to this end because it allows us to examine a large body of data points that hold patterns which we would not necessarily be able to identify through simple analysis. A machine learning model takes that body of disparate data, 'learns' patterns in it that correspond to a particular label, and determines how closely that new unit matches the patterns associated with each label, resulting in a prediction for membership in a class/label. </p>

<p>Running <em>df.info()</em> gives me a basic overview of the data shape and column data types.</p>
<p>I see that there are 146 records, and 22 columns.</p>
<p>Each column has 146 values. The data-type for each of the columns is <em>non-null object</em>. This is confusing, because looking at the first few rows of the dataframe reveals that there are plenty of <em>'NaN'</em> values, which means that at least some of the columns should have less than 146 values. Also, the data types of the various features are clearly not all <em>'non-null object'</em>.  There should be string types, numerics, integers, and booleans. </p>
<p>I'll take a closer look at the NaNs to see if there is some issue with them.</p>

<h2>Prepare for Model Creation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most (all?) ML models will reject any record that has a NaN for any features. Since there are so many NaNs, to get off the ground, I'm going to fill them with zero. </p>
<p>Now I load feature and target data into X and Y variables.  These will be used to make the train / test split. </p>
<p>For the featured data, I remove the index, email address, and poi columns because the first two would cause the data to overfit, and the second contains the labels, respectively.  </p>

<p>One potential issue is the imbalanced nature of the dataset in terms of POI / not-POI.  Only 12% of the overall records are </p>
<p>Only 12% of the records in the overall dataset are POIs.  This means that our model would be about 88% accurate if it predicted not-POI for every single record.  This means we will need to either alter the training data to make it balanced in terms of POI / not-POI, or use different metrics like Area Under ROC (AUROC) to calculate the probability that the model is predicting a true negative or a false negative.  Realistically, we should do both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I picked six supervised classification algorithms to test. My idea is to test 
the algorithms raw, without any dimensionality reduction, feature transformation 
or algorithm tuning. This will help me get a baseline understanding of how the
 models perform. After that, I will set up a grid of parameters for each 
 algorithm and use grid search to find each one's best estimator parameters.  </p>
<p>Based on that, I might try some dimensionality reduction, feature scaling, and principal component analysis. </p>
<p>If results are still not good enough, I could try creating a new training data set with balanced POI - nonPOI classes (by randomaly upsampling the POIs).</p>
<p>Which algorithms could use feature scaling:
<em> KNN
</em> Logistic Regression
<em> SVM
</em> Prior to PCA</p>
<p>""An alternative standardization is scaling features to lie between a given minimum and maximum value, often between zero and one, or so that the maximum absolute value of each feature is scaled to unit size. This can be achieved using MinMaxScaler or MaxAbsScaler, respectively.</p>
<p>The motivation to use this scaling include robustness to very small standard deviations of features and preserving zero entries in sparse data.
""</p>
<p>I tried Standard scaling, and then I tried MinMax. Since there are a lot of zeros in the data set (from all the NaNs), I thought minMax could be helpful. </p>

<h2>Process Notes</h2>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>The goal of this project was to build a model that, trained on financial and email data for the Enron employees, could then predict whether an unseen employee, by virtue of their data, was a person-of-interest (POI) in the fraud investigation. Machine learning is useful to this end because it allows us to examine a large body of data points that hold patterns which we would not necessarily be able to identify through simple analysis. A machine learning model takes that body of disparate data, 'learns' patterns in it that correspond to a particular label, and determines how closely that new unit matches the patterns associated with each label, resulting in a prediction for membership in a class/label. 
​
The dataset is full of numerical data corresponding to behaviors like number of emails sent, or compensation attributes like bonuses. This numerical data, or categorical data converted to numerical data, can be fed into statistical calculations which help the model identify patterns. According to the technical definition of an outlier, as a certain proportion above the 75th percentile, there are many outliers. Given the nature of the distribution of corporate compensation, however, these outliers are not actually erroneous. There was one erroneous outlier which represented the maximum value in most features. This was the TOTAL record, which held the total amounts for all the different features. I just removed that record from the train/test data. This wasn't an outlier issue, but there were two data cleanliness issues that had to be handled. The NaN values were not np.nan's, but simply a string "NaN". I replaced all those strings with np.nan's. The second issue was there were a lot of NaN values. To deal with this, I replaced all the NaNs with zeros. To compensate for the loss of that information, I created some new features (see below).
<br>
​</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>​
In my final POI identifier with the best score (Gradient Boosting), I used 32 features. To get to 32 features, however, I started with all but six features from the core Enron dataset. Those six featres are poi, index, email_address, shared_receipt_with_poi, from_poi_to_this_person, and from_this_person_to_poi. I removed the POI feature because that is the label I am trying to predict. I removed the Index and email_address features because they contain data that is too specific to individuals, and would cause the model to memorize features associated with those individuals' name or email address. Lastly, I didn't use the three email-poi features because it seemed like cheating, since it would be building in information that was tainted with POI identification. 
​
Once I had selected my main features, I engineered new features, and performed several transformations on the data. To preserve some of the information from the fields where NaNs were converted to zeros, I made a dummy column for each feature, where NaN values are 1, and non-NaN values are zero. Using the dummy features produced a better result than without them, which wasn't true for every classifier I tested. 
​
In addition, since the POI / not-POI classes are so imbalanced (88% not-POI overall), there is not much data to train the models what a POI looks like. As an attempt to remedy this, I divided the training data into POI / non-POI sets, and randomly upsampled the POI set so that after combining the upsampled POI set and the original non-POI set, there would be the same number of POI records to train on.  I tested each model with and without the upsampled data, and the performance improved on all but one (Naive Bayes) with upsampled data. 
​
After this, I transformed the data with a StandardScaler. Since the features contained such a broad range of values, like the 0-1 scale in the dummy features, to the 32m dollar range for total_exercised_stock_options, the wide-scale data could drown out the narrow-scale data, so I scaled it. StandardScaler produced better results than MinMaxScaler. 
​
After scaling the data, I used Principal Component Analysis to transform the data again. Interestingly, leaving the n_components parameter of PCA at its default of None (which uses all the PCs) produced the best results, even though the first 4-6 PCs account for the bulk of tha variance. <em>(See chart below of PCs vs Explained Variance)</em>
<img alt="PCAncomps.png" src="attachment:PCAncomps.png">
When I plot the feature scores for the GradientBoosting classifier, I can see quite a bit of variation in feature importance across the 32 principal components. Since these 32 PCs are composite features and thus do not correspond directly to the 32 features, I can't tell which of the original features had the most predictive impact. <em>(See chart below of PCs and their feature importances)</em>
<img alt="PCsFeatImps.png" src="attachment:PCsFeatImps.png">
Since I felt deprived by this, I ran SelectKBest on my close runner-up classifier, KNeighbors. While running SelectKBest actually decreased the KNC accuracy, it was still interesting to the plot the feature importances. <em>(See chart below of features and their feature scores)</em>
<img alt="KBestPlot.png" src="attachment:KBestPlot.png">
The top four features, listed in descending order of importance, are: Bonus, exercised stock options, salary, total_stock value. Notably not useful are count of to and from email messages, deferral payments, restricted stock deferred, and long term incentive. That last one is not surprising given the clear short-term focus of the fraudsters. 
<br>
​</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>​
In all, I tested six algorithms: Logistic Regression, Guassian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and the K Neighbors Classifier. Of those, the two with the best performance are the Gradient Boosting CLassifier and the K Neighbors Classifier, with the Boosting algorithm having a slight advantage in precision (.6 vs .5). Except for the Support Vector Classifier, which kept crashing, all the algorithms worked well and reached reasonable levels of performance. I tried each algorithm with and without dummy variables, GridSearch for parameter tuning, PCA, two different scaling mechanisms, and upsampled or not-upsampled data. 
​
Model performance varied between each model, and with all the different combinations listed above. Some did better with the things that made the others do worse. Some of this variation made sense, like the Gaussian Naive Bayes performing better with StandardScaler vs MinMaxScaler, other factors did not have a clear explanation. I chose the top two to really explore based on best combination of recall and precision (with more emphasis on recall).
<br>
​</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>​
Each model has different parameters that determine how the model goes about fitting to the data. These parameters differ from model to model because they are pertinent to the overall approach of each model, which means you have to learn about each one, what parameters you can change, and what combination of parameters might be appropriate given the data and the objectives.
​
Using GridSearch Cross Validation, I tuned almost all the parameters on each of the algorithms I tested. I also concurrently tested the algorithms and estimator pipeline with the default parameter settings, which often turned out to be better than the best parameter combinations found by GridSearch. <br>
<br>
​</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>​
Validation is the processing of checking the performance of your model against a portion of the data that you did not use for training. One way you could do this wrong (I'm sure there are several) would be to train your model on all the data, and then use a portion of that same data to validate the model's performance. Since the model was trained using a dataset that included your 'validation data', this flawed validation process will probably show good model performance and deceive you into thinking your model is good, when in fact it is simply 'remembering' the data you trained it with. A correct strategy is to segregate the training and validation data, so after tuning the model in response to the validation process, your model is only somewhat biased towards the validation data. Ideally, there would be a third set of true test data, that is only used to test the final, tuned model. 
​
I validated my analysis by dividing the Enron data into training and testing portions, dividing by a 70/30 train / test split. I would predict the labels for my test set, and use the results to assess performance. A more automatic process I also used was to run GridSearchCrossvalidation on the training data. This method slices the <em>training data</em> into multiple, smaller train/validation splits, and tests combinations of model parameters using those splits to find the best combination. Part of this process is telling the GridSearch what metric to use when finding this "best" combination. For each classifier, I tested the GridSearch output using multiple different scoring functions: precision, recall, f1, roc_auc, and the default, which is the underlying classifier's scoring function. 
<br>
​</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>​
Most of the time trying different models and combinations of data (w/wo dummy variables or w/wo upsampled POI records) and parameters with GridSearch, different scoring functions yielded different performance, all other variables held constant. My goal was to find a model with recall and precision as high as possible. Since we are trying to identify Persons-of-Interest, who would then be subject to investigation, it seemed more important to flag as many POIs as was reasonable, even at the expense of flagging innocent people. The recall metric helps us flag as many of the POIs as we can, as it represents how many we could 'recall' from the dataset. Precision represents the proportion of those people we flagged, who were actually POIs, which is important because if we deluge the results with 'false positives', we aren't much better off than when we started. 
​
Finding a good balance between the two metrics is a fairly subjective process. For my best two models, KNeighbors and Gradient Boosting Classifiers, I was able to reach recall of 0.75 and precision of 0.5 and 0.6, respectively. Using a confusion matrix helped me to see in absolute terms how many people I was catching, and falsely accusing. For example, with the Gradient Boosting Classifier, out of 44 people, my best estimate was that five were POIs and 39 were 'innocent'. There were actually four POIs, of which I only got three. Of the five I accused, only three out of the five were actually guilty.
